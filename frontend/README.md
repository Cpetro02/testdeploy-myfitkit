# Frontend Breakdown
Frontend is where the React application is housed. React is a JS library for building frontend UIs.  
Instead of 1 HTML script, the UI's are composed of customizable functions, called components.

React code is in `/src`  

## App.JS
- This is the MAIN component. It runs all other components & renders the app.

## components
- Components are isolated pieces of code doing specific functions for the app.
